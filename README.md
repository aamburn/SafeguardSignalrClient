Safeguard Signalr Client
========================

This repository is a simple Signalr Client implemented using the Safeguard Dot Net library. 

Usage
------------------------

Build the solution then run SafeguardSignalrClient.exe. It takes the following parameters: 

- URL - IP address or hostname of target Safeguard Appliance
- THUMBPRINT - thumbprint of a certificate user
- EVENT - the event to subscribe to

Additional info
-----------

I added, but commented out, GUI authentication. You can uncomment that and use if if you prefer.
